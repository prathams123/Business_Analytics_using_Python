# Stock Market Analysis and Clustering

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of stock market data using Python, focusing on historical prices, returns, and clustering of stocks based on their performance. The analysis includes data fetching, preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, and clustering using the KMeans algorithm. This repository is a useful tool for analyzing stock trends, assessing risks, and grouping similar stocks for better investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Automatically download historical stock data for multiple tickers over a specified period.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data, calculate daily returns and log returns, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate various plots to visualize stock prices, returns, and their distributions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate key metrics such as mean return, volatility, and annualized volatility for each stock.
- **Clustering**: Group similar stocks using the KMeans algorithm based on their returns and log returns.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Visualize the results of the clustering process and compare the performance of stocks within each cluster.
